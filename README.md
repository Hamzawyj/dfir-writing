# DFIR Writing Portfolio

This repository is a structured index of my **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)** blog posts.

Each blog post has its own markdown file with:
- A link to the original article (e.g. Forensafe blog)
- A short summary
- DFIR-relevant notes (artifact paths, fields, investigation value, etc.)

---

## 📚 Posts

- [Android Application Operations](posts/android-application-operations.md)  
  Android system artifact that records permission-related operations performed by apps.

> More posts will be added here as I publish new articles.

---

## 🧪 Focus areas

- Android & mobile forensics (artifacts, logs, backups)
- Tool behavior and parsing (e.g. ArtiFast)
- How artifacts answer concrete investigation questions
