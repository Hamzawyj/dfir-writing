# DFIR Writing Portfolio

This repository is a structured index of my **Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)** blog posts.

Each blog post has its own markdown file with:
- A link to the original article (e.g. Forensafe blog)
- A short summary
- DFIR-relevant notes (artifact paths, fields, investigation value, etc.)
